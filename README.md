# GREURO
## A cheaper and more ecological alternative to Bitcoins (and much sexier than GREXIT)

### Summary

One major problem : **the [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network) 
network has an enormous energy footprint, it already uses around as much electricity 
as the republic of Ireland**

A solution: the GREURO is designed to use a trusted central blockchain run by the 
Greek State. GREUROs are transferable digital certificates than can be converted 
to [EUROs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro). (Some limitations on how many 
EUROs can be converted by person and day might be in place).

* Much more energy efficient, thus cheaper transactions
* Backed by an external value (EUROs) thus more stable
* For Greece lot of microcredits from the masses
* For us, lots of benefits.

An essential security feature of Bitcoins is the Proof of Work. Computers solve 
cryptological puzzles as a 
[Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) 
when approving changes into the 
[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29).

This proof of work is an elegant solution to allow for a decentralized network 
in an anonymous network. However it brings huge energy costs,  even though today 
only a very small fraction of the monetary transactions are bitcoin transactions.

## How does it work?

Compared with the Bitcoin block chains things are quite easy.

### Generations of new GREUROs

The GREUROs are released by the Greek State, basically it's a document digitally
signed by the Greek State:

    The Hellenic Republic (the emitter) promises to pay the holder of this GREURO 
    the amount of 1 EURO. As holder of this GREURO shall either be the person that 
    can identify as the original holder of this GREURO or any person that can 
    provide cryptographic proof that the orginal holder transferred the rights on 
    this GREURO to them either directly or via a cryptographically proven transfer
    chain. The first person presenting as holder of this GREURO shall be considered 
    the legitimate owner, to any person subsequently attempting to cash the same 
    GREURO the emitter will provide cryptograph evidence that a person in the 
    transfer chain duplicated (double spent) the GREURO.

    Fineprint: max. transaction fee, possibility of temporary limitations, ....

    Number: 43295873

    Intial Owner {
       Name (optional): Alice.
       Public Key: 7F87 5B8C ........
    }

### Forwarding GREUROs

Alice who got the first GREURO wants to use it to pay for a drink and consequently 
transfer it to Bob. She basically just takes the above document including its 
signature by the Greek State and adds the new owner before signing it with her 
key (i.e. with the secret key that matches the public key in the owner section 
of the original document).

    [Signed original document]

    I hereby transfer all my rights on this GREURO to the new owner below. I promise
    that I only transfer this GREURO to the new owner specified it this document and
    will not cash the GREURO myself.

    New Owner {
       Name (optional): Bob.
       Public Key: 3D63 Fe45 ........
    }

Bob can now either trust Alice and keep the document as it is, or convert it to a 
new GREURO using the online services of the Greek State. Even though the transaction 
fee to create a brand new GREURO from a transferred one is very low, Bob decides 
not to convert the GREURO. Instead he uses the GREURO to pay one his staff member 
Carol. The new digitally singed document is quite similar to the above one.

    [The document Alice Signed]

    I hereby transfer all my rights on this GREURO to the new owner below. I promise
    that I only transfer this GREURO to the new owner specified it this document and
    will not cash the GREURO myself. If any of the earlier parties in the transfer
    chain have double spent this GREURO I shall reimburse the new owner in full.

    New Owner {
       Name (optional): Carol.
       Public Key: 8D33 567F ........
    }

Carol can either just trust Bob or convert the GREURO for a brand new one with 
the online service of the Greek State. If nobody double spent, Carol will get 
the bran new GREURO (like the one Alice had, except with her name on it). If however 
Alice broke her promise and double spent the GREURO to Dave who cashed (or converted) 
it right away, the Greek Server will refuse to accept Carol's GREURO and tell her 
that Alice double spent the GREURO. Carol will now go back to Bob and ask for 
another GREURO, after refunding Carol Bob will try to find Alice and blame himself 
for having trusted her.

## Advantages compared with Bitcoins

 * Much more energy efficient, thus cheaper transactions
 * Backed by an external value (EUROs) thus more stable

## Advantages for Greece

 * A lot of microcredits from the masses, this would be 4x10^9 € when reaching the volume of Bitcoins.

## Advantages for the rest of us

 * Cheaper payments
 * Infrastructure that could be used with other virtual currencies, allowing for social and personal currencies.
 * Less currency risks than with bitcoins, as we all know how hard the Greek work to pay debts back (while we have no guarantee for the value of the bitcoins).
 * With bitcoins we never know for sure that a transaction won't be reversed, its only a question of computational power invested. By contrast by converting a GREURO we have the guarantee that the transaction cannot be reversed.
